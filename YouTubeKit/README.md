## Make requests:
Every possible request within YouTubeKit conforms to the protocol [YouTubeResponse](https://github.com/b5i/YouTubeKit/blob/c858d62d49946658df7c00f9380b04f3f78e32d0/Sources/YouTubeKit/YouTubeResponse.swift#L31), it contains a few useful methods: 
- `static var headersType` is a static variable indicating the type of headers used to make the request, its documentation indicates which parameter to provide in order to make the request work.
- `static var parametersValidationList` is a static variable indicating if further processing and validation should be done on the parameters of the request. It can be validating that a videoId has the right format or simply that a parameter is provided.
- `static func validateRequest(data: inout RequestData) throws` is the method that will be called before sending the request over the internet. It will forward the errors given by the validators from `parametersValidationList` if there's some.
- `static func decodeData(data: Data) throws -> Self` is a static method used to decode some Data and give back in instance of the `YouTubeResponse`. Except for some special cases (if the raw data can't directly be converted into JSON for instance), you won't need to override the default implementation of this method.
- `static func decodeJSON(json: JSON) -> Self` is a static method used to decode some JSON and give back in instance of the `YouTubeResponse`, if the JSON does not represent a proper response it will return an empty response (only nils and empty arrays).
- `static func checkForErrors(json: JSON) throws` is a static method that should be called before calling `decodeJSON(json: JSON)` to avoid trying to decode some JSON that represents an error. Except for some special cases (errors returned for this request are in a non-standart format), you won't need to override the default implementation.
- `static func sendNonThrowingRequest()` and `static func sendThrowingRequest()` are static methods that allows you to make requests, by using async await system or closures. Its usage will be precised in the following tutorial.

With YouTubeKit you can make a large variety of requests to the YouTube API, new request types are added often and you can even create your own in [Custom requests/responses](#custom-requests-and-responses).

1. Make sure you have an instance of `YouTubeModel`, if not you can create one with
  ```swift
  let YTM = YouTubeModel()
  ```
2. Define the request's data parameters, to get the demanded headers you can look at the definition of your `YouTubeResponse.headersType` it should describe which data to send. 
   An example with a `SearchResponse`:
   
   a. Right click on the type of request and press `Jump to definition`, the `SearchResponse.headersType` is `HeaderTypes.search`.
   
   b. Its definition is
   ```swift
   /// Get search results.
   /// - Parameter query: Search query
   case search
   ```

   it means that you will have to provide a query for the request to work and give a relevant result.

   c. You will define the data parameters like this:
   ```swift
   let textQuery: String = "my super query"
   let dataParameters: [HeadersList.AddQueryInfo.ContentTypes : String] = [
       .query: textQuery
   ]
   ```

4. Execute the request with (e.g. a `SearchResponse` request)
  ```swift
  SearchResponse.sendNonThrowingRequest(youtubeModel: YTM, data: dataParameters, result: { result, error in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        /// Process here the result.
        print(response)
    case .failure(let error):
        /// If there is no result you should obtain an error explaining why there is none.
        print(error)
    }
  })
  ```
  you can also send the request without explicitly declaring `dataParameters` like this:
  ```swift
  SearchResponse.sendNonThrowingRequest(youtubeModel: YTM, data: [.query: textQuery], result: { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        /// Process here the result.
        print(response)
    case .failure(let error):
        /// If there is no result you should obtain an error explaining why there is none.
        print(error)
    }
  })
  ```
  and even use the async/throws API like this:
  ```swift
  let result = try await SearchResponse.sendThrowingRequest(youtubeModel: YTM, data: [.query: textQuery])
  switch result {
  case .success(let response):
        /// Process here the result.
        print(response)
  case .failure(let error):
        /// If there is no result you should obtain an error explaining why there is none.
        print(error)
  }
  ```
### Cookies usage
YouTubeKit allows you to add an account's cookies into the requests by following those steps:
1. Define the cookies variable in your YouTubeModel:
```swift
let YTM = YouTubeModel()
YTM.cookies = "myCookies"
```
2. If you want to always use cookies when making requests you can opt to set the `alwaysUseCookies` of the `YouTubeModel` like so:
```swift
let YTM = YouTubeModel()
YTM.cookies = "myCookies"
YTM.alwaysUseCookies = true
```
3. You can also choose to use cookies by request by specifying the `useCookies` parameter present in every request function.

### Debugging requests/responses
YouTubeKit has a built-in way to actively debug requests/responses at runtime.
1. For that, create your type of `RequestsLogger` and add it to the `logger` property of your `YouTubeModel`.
```swift
class Logger: RequestsLogger {
    var loggedTypes: [any YouTubeResponse.Type]? = nil

    var logs: [YouTubeKit.RequestLog] = []
            
    var isLogging: Bool = false
    
    var maximumCacheSize: Int? = nil
}
        
let logger = Logger()
        
YTM.logger = logger
```
2. Enable logging by calling the `startLogging` method of your logger:
```swift
logger.startLogging()
```
3. A full log of every request that has finished when `logger.isLogging` is true is stored in `logger.logs` by chronological order. Be aware that enabling logging can consume a lot of RAM as the logger stores a lot of raw informations. Therefore, make sure that you regularly clear the ``logger.logs`` using `logger.clearLogs`, disable logging when it's not needed or set a reasonable cache limit using `logger.setCacheSize()`.

### Custom request calls
A lot of structures and protocol have custom request calls (shortcuts to various `YouTubeResponse`), here is a few examples:

    1. `YouTubeVideo` (`YTVideo` conforms to it) has:
    
        1. `fetchStreamingInfos` that can be used to retrieve the basic streaming data.
        
        2. `fetchStreamingInfosWithDownloadFormats` that is the same as `fetchStreamingInfos` but it includes the download formats (all the different video/audio formats you can stream/download the video).
        
        3. `fetchMoreInfos` that can be used to retrieve more infos about the video (recommended videos, description with chapters and links, and more!).
        
        4. `likeVideo`, `dislikeVideo`, `removeLikeFromVideo`.
        
        5. `fetchAllPossibleHostPlaylists`
        
    2. `YouTubeChannel` (`YTChannel`and `YTLittleChannelInfos` are conform to it) has:
    
        1. `fetchInfos` that can be used to retrieve various informations about the channel.
        
    3. `ContinuableResponse` (`HomeScreenResponse`, `SearchResponse`, `PlaylistInfosResponse` are conform to it) has:
    
        1. `mergeContinuation` to merge the continuations easily.
        
        2. `fetchContinuation` to get those continuations.
        
    4. `HistoryResponse` has `removeVideo` that can be used to remove a video from the history.

## Custom requests and responses:
To create custom headers and so custom request/response function, you have to:
1. Append the function that is used to generate the `HeadersList` in `YouTubeModel.customHeadersFunctions`, e.g

```swift
let YTM = YouTubeModel()
let myCustomHeadersFunction: () -> HeadersList = {
    HeadersList(
        url: URL(string: "https://www.myrequesturl.com")!,
        method: .POST,
        headers: [
            .init(name: "Accept", content: "*/*"),
            .init(name: "Accept-Encoding", content: "gzip, deflate, br"),
            .init(name: "Accept-Language", content: "\(YTM.selectedLocale);q=0.9"),
        ],
        addQueryAfterParts: [
            .init(index: 0, encode: true)
        ],
        httpBody: [
            "my query is: ",
            " and it is really cool!"
        ]
    )
}

YouTubeModel.shared.customHeadersFunctions["myHeadersID"] = myCustomHeadersFunction
```
2. Create the response that is conform to the YouTubeResponse protocol, e.g
```swift
/*
We imagine that the JSON is of the form:
{
  "name": "myName",
  "surname": "mySurname"
}
*/


/// Struct representing a getNameAndSurname response.
public struct NameAndSurnameResponse: YouTubeResponse {
    public static var headersType: HeaderTypes = .customHeaders("myHeadersID") //<- the myHeadersID has to be the same as the one you defined in step 1!
    
    public static var parametersValidationList: ValidationList = [:] // we don't need any validators here as there's no parameters to provide.
    
    /// String representing a name.
    public var name: String = ""
    
    /// String representing a surname.
    public var surname: String = ""
    
    public static func decodeJSON(json: JSON) -> NameAndSurnameResponse {
        /// Initialize an empty response.
        var nameAndSurnameResponse = NameAndSurnameResponse()
                
        nameAndSurnameResponse.name = json["name"].stringValue
        nameAndSurnameResponse.surname = json["surname"].stringValue
        
        return nameAndSurnameResponse
    }
}
```
3. And to exectute it you just have to call `func sendRequest(
    youtubeModel: YouTubeModel,
    data: [HeadersList.AddQueryInfo.ContentTypes : String],
    result: @escaping (Result<ResponseType, Error>) -> ()
)`
e.g,
```swift
/// We continue with our example:
NameAndSurnameResponse.sendNonThrowingRequest(youtubeModel: YTM, data: [:], result: { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        /// Process here the result.
        print(response)
    case .failure(let error):
        /// If there is no result you should obtain an error explaining why there is none.
        print(error)
    }
})
```
Note: you would include in the request the parameters if needed like: query, browseId or anything like this to put in the body of the request to send.

## Troubleshooting: 
This category lists solutions to problems you might encounter with YouTubeKit.

### Connections problems
- ```Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1003 "A server with the specified hostname could not be found."```

  This issue can be resolved by enabling the `Outgoing Connections (Client)` in the `Signing & Capabilities` category of your project's target in Xcode.

- The download speed is very low when downloading an audio-only `DownloadFormat`: this issue can be resolved by adding the `range: bytes=0-(CONTENT_LENGHT_BYTES)` HTTP header to your `URLRequest` (e.g. `request.addValue("bytes=0-\(myDownloadFormat.contentLength ?? "")", forHTTPHeaderField: "range")`).

### Request results problems
- The result of a request is empty: this issue could be caused by the locale that could be in the wrong format. Make sure that your `YouTubeModel.selectedLocale` is like `en-US`.
